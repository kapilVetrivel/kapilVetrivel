- 👋 Hi, I’m Kapil
- 👀 I’m interested in Cars, Design & Thermal
- 🎓 Engineering Management grad. student at Tufts
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Customer Discovery, AI Agents, and Robotics.
- 💞️ I like hiking (not pro), driving, and some live music as well (may be I play a brass instrument one day).

Stuffs I did over time (i'm updating them slowly...):

- [2025] Sep - Started my MS in Engineering Management at Tufts Gordon Institute, Boston, US.
- [2021] Mar - Started with Mercedes-Benz R&D India, Bangalore.
- [2020] Mar - Worked at IIT Madras - Center for Battery Engg. & EVs.
- [2019] Mar - Interned with Mercedes-Benz R&D India, Bangalore.
- [2016] Jun - Got into Hybrutos Racing to build Formula hybrid SAE cars
  - Started with CAD for KTM Duke 200 Engine in Creo - spent most of my time using vernier callipers.
  - Designed engine mounts and simulated them for structural performance in Optistruct - Hypermesh tools have steep learning curve.
  - Designed exhaust runner and fabricated using Stainless Steel EN 304 material. discovered fabrication techniques and started working with local fabricators.
  - Assisted with chassis fabrication - used 1:1 scale printouts of pipe ends and profiled chassis pipe members.
  - Reverse engineered engine output shaft location and cylinder head - got my hands on Carl Zeiss CMM and 3D scanning equipment.
  - My quick learning of engine working gave my seniors confidence to work further on engine ECU and stuffs.
  - We got the engine running on our own ECU after a long stint - Learnt Engine electronics, CAN debugging, LV wiring harness fabrication, and more.
  - I undertook the responsibility of putting all stuffs together on CAD - basically packaging studies.
  - Thing that bugged all of us - The clutch, we though freeplay rotation was the clutch lever motion (we never actuated the clutch at all) until a friendly mechanic helped us understand it.
  - First participation in formula hybrid SAE 2017 at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, US. Got ourselves through static events.
  - Couldn't get the engine running until end of competition - failed to understand E85 vs Gasoline. Ended up breaking the engine - Thanks to Michael Royce for educating us.
  - Returned and concluded with immense learnings. Hugely thankful to my seniors for trusting me.
  - Get into 3rd year with all learnings. Now we get to make intake/exhaust/cooling system/electroincs our own way.
- [2015] Jul - Started my Mechanical Engg. journey art SRM IST, Chennai.
